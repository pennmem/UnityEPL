This prefab allows Unity experiments to communicate with ramulator using four functions.  These are the four public methods of the RamulatorInterface.cs class: BeginNewSession, BeginNewTrial, SetState, and SendMathMessage.  Please refer to the documentary comments for these functions for usage information.  Note that SetState requires a dictionary of extra data, and ramulator may require this extra data to contain specific entries for certain states.
